\section{Motivation}
The implementation of our Paxos contains certain constants that greatly affect the behavior of the system.  In our implementation, we have the two constants of "master timeouts" and "heartbeat frequencies" that can influence the behavior and performance of our system.  Often such constants are evaluated and determined in the network of operation to determine the ideal values for the best overall performance, and these values are seldom revisited at later times.  Because the conditions of network (i.e. network latency) can change [--citation?--], as time goes on, those initially determined constants may no longer be the best values given the change in the network.

Because of this, we hypothesized that a Paxos system that \textit{measures} and \textit{adapts} to its environment will perform better than one that does not.  Specifically, we aimed to build a Paxos system that measured its network latency and node drops and responds appropriately by adjusting its master timeout and heartbeat frequency constants to better perform in its current environment.
