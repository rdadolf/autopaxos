\begin{abstract}
Herein we describe the development of \emph{Autopaxos}, a distributed-consensus system that measures and adapts to environment.  Because a network environment continuously changes, Paxos parameters that were initially determined might be adversely affecting the system's performance once its environment sufficiently changes.  In this way, we hypothesized that a Paxos System that measures and adapts to its changing environment will perform better than one that does not.  We implemented our Paxos Servers to monitor the environment by tracking the network's latency through RTT estimates and node drop events.  We developed an analytical cost-model to optimize performance by picking the best heartbeat frequency and master timeout parameters for the current environment.  We found that \emph{Autopaxos} appropriately measures its environment and adjusts its parameters for the best policy metric score, but a difference in performance was not observable.
