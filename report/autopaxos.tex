\begin{abstract}
Herein we describe the development of \emph{Autopaxos}, a distributed-consensus system that measures and adapts to its environment.  Because a network environment is continuously changing, Paxos parameters that were initially determined might not be the most beneficial for a system's performance at later times.  In this way, we hypothesized that a Paxos System that measures and adapts to its changing environment will perform better than one that does not.  We implemented our Paxos Servers to monitor its environment by tracking the network's latency through RTT estimates and node drop events.  We developed an analytical cost-model to optimize performance by picking the best heartbeat frequency and master timeout parameters for the current environment.  We found that \emph{Autopaxos} appropriately measures its environment and adjusts its parameters for the best policy metric score, but no significant difference in performance was observable due to these changes.
